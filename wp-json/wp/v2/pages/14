This course will provide both rigorous mathematical basis (proof based) and useful engineering values (applications). This course will cover 5 major topics: (i) review of probability theory, (ii) discrete-time Markov chain, (iii) Poisson process and its generalizations, (iv) continuous-time Markov chain and (v) renewal counting process. This course has 12 homework sets (each having 8 problems), two midterms and one final exam. The textbooks are &#8220;Introduction to probability models&#8221;, 10th Ed, Sheldon Ross; and &#8220;Stochastic Processes&#8221;, 2nd Ed, Sheldon Ross.

This\u00a0course also can serve as part of an introduction to probability theory and its applications, being\u00a0a sequel to ST 371 &#8211; Introduction to Probability Theory. In a first course on probability (such as\u00a0ST 371) students learn about random variables and their probability distributions. In that first\u00a0course, attention is usually focused on only one or two random variables. In this subsequent course\u00a0we will extend the focus to stochastic processes, which are collections of random variables, usually\u00a0indexed by time (either discrete or continuous).\u00a0Stochastic modeling appears to be an important and fundamental tool in operations research. For\u00a0example, we might use stochastic processes to model the evolution of a stock price over time, the\u00a0damage claims received by an insurance company over time, the work-in-process inventory in a\u00a0factory over time or the number of calls waiting in telephone call center over time, all of which\u00a0evolve with considerable uncertainty.\u00a0The textbook is &#8220;Introduction to probability models&#8221;, 10th Ed, Sheldon Ross.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ISE\/OR 761 &#8211; Advanced Stochastic Models and Queues<\/strong> (Ph.D.), Spring 2015 &#8211; present [<a href=\"http:\/\/yunanliu.wordpress.ncsu.edu\/files\/2014\/02\/Syllabus.pdf\">Syllabus<\/a>]\n<em>Prerequisit<\/em>: ISE\/OR 760<br \/>\n<em>Description<\/em>: This course is a sequel to\u00a0<em>ISE 760 Applied Stochastic Models<\/em>, aiming at supplementing ISE 760 by introducing new stochastic processes with an emphasis on queueing theory. Queueing theory is the mathematical theory of congestion as is associated with delays while waiting in a line or queue for service in a system. Examples of such systems include banks, post offices and supermarkets, as well as telecommunication systems involving telephones, computer networks, internet\/world wide web, inventory, health care and manufacturing processes. Much of the theory relies heavily on the use of probability theory and stochastic processes (of which queueing theory is viewed as a subfield). There is also significant interplay with other fields such as scheduling theory, inventory theory and insurance risk theory. Queueing theory is a central part of operations research.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ISE\/OR 762 &#8211; Stochastic Simulation<\/strong>\u00a0(Ph.D.), Spring 2016 [<a href=\"https:\/\/yunanliu.wordpress.ncsu.edu\/files\/2014\/02\/Syllabus_762.pdf\">Syllabus<\/a>]\n<em>Prerequisit<\/em>: ISE\/OR 760<br \/>\n<em>Description<\/em>: Advanced topics in stochastic system simulation, including random variate generation, output estimation for stationary and non-stationary models, performance optimization techniques, variance reduction approaches.

Important examples are healthcare systems (hospitals), financial services (banks) and telephone and internet services. In many respects, service systems are similar to manufacturing systems, communication systems, and transportation systems, but there are important differences, largely due to the significant role played by humans in providing the service. Fortunately, there is a growing service science that provides skills and tools to manage service systems. In this course, service systems are\u00a0viewed as stochastic networks. Thus the main theoretical framework is queueing theory, which primarily involves a large class of stochastic models. However, the subject matter is highly multi-disciplinary; hence alternative frameworks will be useful as well, including ones from Statistics, Psychology, and Marketing. The course will provide a framework for modeling service systems and techniques that are useful to design, analyze, and operate service systems. We will use real service system data from banks, hospitals, and call centers to demonstrate the use of the decision support tools.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ISE 76x &#8211; Applied Stochastic Models II<\/strong> (Ph.D.), Term: TBD.<br \/>\n<em>Description<\/em>: This future course will be a sequel to <em>ISE 760 Applied Stochastic Models<\/em>, aiming at supplementing ISE 760 by introducing new stochastic processes, such as martingales, Brownian motions,\u00a0branching processes, regenerative processes and Markov renewal processes. If your research involves using stochastic models; if you want to know more stochastic processes; if liked ISE 760 or if you took ISE 760 and got a good grade, you should consider taking this course. There will be about 6 homework sets (biweekly), a midterm and a take home final exam.
