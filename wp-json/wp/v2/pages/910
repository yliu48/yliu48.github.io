This course will provide both rigorous mathematical basis (proof based) and useful engineering values (applications). This course will cover 5 major topics: (i) review of probability theory, (ii) discrete-time Markov chain, (iii) Poisson process and its generalizations, (iv) continuous-time Markov chain and (v) renewal counting process. This course has 12 homework sets (each having 8 problems), two midterms and one final exam. The textbooks are &#8220;Introduction to probability models&#8221;, 10th Ed, Sheldon Ross; and &#8220;Stochastic Processes&#8221;, 2nd Ed, Sheldon Ross.

Examples of such systems include banks, post offices and supermarkets, as well as telecommunication systems involving telephones, computer networks, internet\/world wide web, inventory, health care and manufacturing processes. Much of the theory relies heavily on the use of probability theory and stochastic processes (of which queueing theory is viewed as a subfield). There is also significant interplay with other fields such as scheduling theory, inventory theory and insurance risk theory.

Important examples are healthcare systems (hospitals), financial services (banks) and telephone and internet services. In many respects, service systems are similar to manufacturing systems, communication systems, and transportation systems, but there are important differences, largely due to the significant role played by humans in providing the service. Fortunately, there is a growing service science that provides skills and tools to manage service systems. In this course, service systems are\u00a0viewed as stochastic networks. Thus the main theoretical framework is queueing theory, which primarily involves a large class of stochastic models. However, the subject matter is highly multi-disciplinary; hence alternative frameworks will be useful as well, including ones from Statistics, Psychology, and Marketing. The course will provide a framework for modeling service systems and techniques that are useful to design, analyze, and operate service systems. We will use real service system data from banks, hospitals, and call centers to demonstrate the use of the decision support tools.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ISE 76x &#8211; Applied Stochastic Models II<\/strong> (Ph.D.), Term: TBD.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Description<\/em>: This future course will be a sequel to <em>ISE 760 Applied Stochastic Models<\/em>, aiming at supplementing ISE 760 by introducing new stochastic processes, such as martingales, Brownian motions,\u00a0branching processes, regenerative processes and Markov renewal processes.
